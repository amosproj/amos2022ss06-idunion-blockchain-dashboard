# Code of Conduct - Branching

> **_Disclaimer:_** We want to orchestrate parallel development by agreeing on a branch strategy. It allows us parallel builds and testing, whilst ensuring to gather feedback quickly. Therefore, we defined a set of rules on which all developers agreed. Those will be outlined in the following.

## 1. Merge early and often
- Avoid merge conflicts and release

## 2. Branches are created from issues from the project's Feature Board (Feature Branching Strategy)
- This keeps the repo clean and changes can be tracked more easily

## 3. Create Pull request, when work on feature is finished
- This allows other developers to have a look at the code

## 4. Merging code into the main branch requires pair-review of the code to be merched
- Securing the quality of the code
- Developers are responsible for quality assurance

## 5. Minimize how long Code is checked out
- This helps us to prevent merge conflicts
