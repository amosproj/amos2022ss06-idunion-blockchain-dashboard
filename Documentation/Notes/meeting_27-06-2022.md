Impediments:
- DID for the ID.union network? The industry partner will check?
- Data of industry partner quite different from the test networks
- Exchange of data to be checked
    
 Wireframe:
 - Indy-node-version: In general is aligned, but at the time of updates some gaps are possible?!
 - Runtime: the industry partner calculates a network outage probability: https://hackmd.io/r73ALSV3SPu7YCgxEDQGBQ
 - Ledger: Industry partner uses Indyscan, but we currently run Indy Node Monitor, see https://idunion.esatus.com/home/IDunion_Test, focusing on the ledger data

KPIs:
- Industry partner looking at high level information and basic KPI
- Currently: Public readable node information, ledger information
- Possible use-case: Connect to node and ask node for information: Look for open ports, requirement to steward to push information
- Intepretation of changed information, in order to detect n.i.O. node, e.g. if Sync is missed to often
- Mix the available information of fetch validator
- Similar to indy node version, check other library versions
- The OS.version, on-prem, cloud?

Alerting:
- Industry partner has 5 KPI for alerting in Grafana: e. g. consensus alert

My notes (Anna):
- there are multiple networks (test network, etc)
- each provider runs one node per network
- there is an upper limit to the number of nodes, so some might be deactivated on purpose
- to use the Idunion test network we need a did with a certain role
- having the dashboard, the alarms and being able to send it to a person via slack is enough
- certain roles are less important than seeing the most important info in a general home view
- indyscan can tell us what's written in the sub-ledgers, you can see all the transactions in contrast to indy node monitor
- sovrin.org/ssi-metrics-dashboard as an example for visualization
- potential new metrics: high-level: everything about the organization being responsible for having a productive ledger running (alle stewards run their node and everything is fine), then alarms if something is happening
- find a way to connect to the node and be able to ask something (one node has two ports and you need to get in there to get info)
- currently they use AWS and login there
