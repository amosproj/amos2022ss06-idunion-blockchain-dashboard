meeting notes

## Implementation
- set-up of own instance/network with nodes
- IDunion: direct implementation on OS:ubuntu-18 (some 20): on-premis, Azure, AWS
- Output of Siemens network: from hyperledger indy monitor
- Sovrin/Ivon network

## Display
- Grafana: Tool Prometeus: processes the file

## Information analysis:
- Find out what information is possible to display, calculate;
- Fetch validation (validator information), send transaction information;
- track node availability
- Reaction time of nodes
- Type of node (e.g. AWS or Azure, native or container)
- List ledgers and credentials of the ledgers

## Information Preferences:
- Load-information: read and write: Read is creating more load;
- Statistics about the network: main node up-time
- Transactions passed
- Ledger explorer and monitor
- Validator information
