Impediments:
- DID for the ID.union network? The industry partner will check 
    
 Wireframe:
 - Indy-node-version: In general is aligned, but at the time of updates some gaps are possible?!
 - Runtime: the industry partner calculates a network outage probability: https://hackmd.io/r73ALSV3SPu7YCgxEDQGBQ
 - Ledger: Industry partner uses Indyscan, but we currently run Indy Node Monitor, see https://idunion.esatus.com/home/IDunion_Test, focusing on the ledger data

KPIs:
- Industry partner looking at high level information and basic KPI
- Currently: Public readable node information, ledger information
- Possible use-case: Connect to node and ask node for information: Look for open ports, requirement to steward to push information
- Intepretation of changed information, in order to detect n.i.O. node, e.g. if Sync is missed to often
