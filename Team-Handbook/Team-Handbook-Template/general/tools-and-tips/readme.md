## Octopus Deploy

[Octopus Deploy](ENTER URL) is our automated deployment tool used mainly for deploying application code. Occasionally it is also used for automating tasks such as IIS Resets, removing bindings etc.

## TeamCity

To put it in simple terms, [TeamCity](ENTER URL)  is our automated build & packaging tool. We use TeamCity for continuous integration - which means when any change happens in source control, our solution will be built, units tests will be run, and the solution output (artifacts) will be produced. (Not all builds are automated as we wish to have control over when they are built)

## Team Foundation Server

[TFS](ENTER URL) is used by the Development Team for source control.

## Toggl

We use Toggl to track our time. All work, planned or unplanned should be recorded using Toggl. If it is unplanned, a Trello card must be created first so you can track your time against it. Further instructions are contained within the Trello board and again you will need to be invited to the team Toggl account.

## Trello

We use Trello to manage the DevOps Team Product Backlog. The Team board can be found [here](ENTER URL) but you will need to be invited. All instructions on how to use this are contained within the board.

## Change Management

We use a Gitlab [Repo](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Rfcs-Template/tree/master/Rfcs-Template/rfcs) to manage signifcant changes using the RFC process.

## Incident Management

We use a Gitlab [Repo](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Post-Mortems-Template/tree/master/Post-Mortems-Template/post-mortems) to manage Incidents & Issues.
