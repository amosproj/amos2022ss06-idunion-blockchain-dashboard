## Edit this Handbook Locally

## Introduction

This is a guide on what you'll need to install and run on your machine so you can make edits locally. This is quicker than in the web interface and allows you a better overview and preview when making complex changes.

## 1. Help is available for team members

If you work for the **[TEAM NAME HERE]** we don't expect you to figure this out by yourself. If you have questions ask anyone for help, you're more likely to have success with:

* People that have been here longer than 3 months, the [team page](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Team-Handbook-Template/tree/master/Team-Handbook-Template/general/team-page) lists people and how long they have been here.
* People that have engineer in their title.

## 2. Install Git

1. Open a terminal.
1. Check your Git version by executing: git --version.
1. If Git is not installed, you should be prompted to install it. 

## 3. Install GitKraken

You can use Git command line or any Git GUI you wish but we highly recommend [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) 

## 4. Install Visual Studio Code

Again, you can use any editor you wish but we highly recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## 5. Add yourself to the Team Page

We are happy to have you join our company and to include you in our [team page](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Team-Handbook-Template/tree/master/Team-Handbook-Template/general/team-page). Please follow the instructions and links below that will guide you through each step. Depending on your familiarity with git. Feel free to ask anyone in the DevOps Team questions along the way.

Most pages that you might want to edit are written in [markdown](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions?hl=en).

1. You should have received an invitation to the [Team](LINK TO PROJECT / REPO HERE) project at your work email account. After creating your account, take note of your username and password, because you will need them throughout these steps.

1. Download Git. Don't forget to add your Git username and to set your email.

1. Update your local repository to the latest commit, execute git pull in your working directory to fetch and merge remote changes.

1. Create and checkout a [new branch](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Team-Handbook-Template/tree/master/Team-Handbook-Template/general/commit-style-guide) for the changes you will be making.

1. Find the picture that youâ€™d like to add to our team page, change the picture's name to the following format: yournameinlowercase.jpg or yournameinlowercase.png and then add it to the Team-Handbook/general/img   directory. Ensure the picture size is around 400x400 (it must be square) and the format is JPEG or PNG. You can resize your picture using a photo editor like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (cross-platform) or online by searching for "image resize". Any picture that you provide should be made black-and-white before you add it to the team page.

1. Add the picture so it is staged for commit.

1. Information displayed on the Team page is pulled from the readme.md file within the team-page folder

1. Your information should be added after the last person on the team page.  Verify that your title is entered correctly. Add the file name of the picture that you uploaded previously. Add your GitLab handle as an image link. Write a story about yourself. Don't forget to use other team members' information as a reference and to respect the spaces between lines. 

1. After you added your information and saved your changes, add the file to be staged for commit

1. After validating your changes, [commit your changes with a comment](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Team-Handbook-Template/tree/master/Team-Handbook-Template/general/commit-style-guide) and push your branch.

1. [Create a Merge Request in GitLab.com](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Team-Handbook-Template/pulls) with the branch that you created. Assign it to your manager for review.
