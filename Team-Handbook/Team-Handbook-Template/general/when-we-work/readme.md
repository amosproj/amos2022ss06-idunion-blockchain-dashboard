## When Do We Work?

* Most people start work around 09:30 and work an 8 hour day
* Respect people's time off, don't send messages or expect replies after your team mates have signed off for the day
* Make sure your team knows if you're not working. Using a calendar is a good way to communicate this
* If a team has a regular standup scheduled you are expected to attend or to let the team know in advance that you can't make it that day.
