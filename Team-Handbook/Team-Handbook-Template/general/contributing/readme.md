## Contributing to the Handbook

We contribute to the Team Handbook through merge requests (MRs). This allows us to do two things:

1. Look back at the history of the handbook and how it evolved over time
1. Have conversations about new additions to the content through the merge request process

## Why we do merge requests

The benefits to doing merge requests are:

* Allow others to explore changes to content
* Share information about what is changing
* Provide an opportunity for the team to help spot any potential oversights/shortcomings
* Provide an opportunity to collaborate on improvements to the content

## General guidance

* Don't rely on someone else to spot and merge your requests - it's your job to find a reviewer and get the content merged
* It often makes sense to split separate chunks of content additions or improvements into multiple merge requests

## Opening a Merge Request

* Before opening the MR, make sure you're up to date with master so that your changes are easier to merge.

* The title and description should help the reviewer. Make the title succinct and descriptive, and then add detail in the description
* The description should summarise your changes, this will make it possible to read through the list of changes and see what happened when
* When raising a MR, the title and description are emailed to those following the repo. Any subsequent changes are not emailed, so it's worth spending a bit of time getting it right at the point of raising the MR.

Note: The canonical description of changes should always be in the individual
commits - Merge Requests are an artefact of GitLab, and we would lose that data
if we switched away. Please refer to the [commit message
styleguide](https://github.com/ghostinthewires/Team-Handbook-Template/tree/master/Team-Handbook-Template/general/commit-style-guide).
