# Team-Handbook-Template

As I started growing my DevOps team this year, I looked for a starter-kit of values and best practices. A lot of great work is being done to discuss cultural problems and their solutions, but it’s coming from a lot of different voices around the web and very little is written in the form of an easy to use Team Handbook.

I wanted to put what I've learned into practice, so I decided to write my own handbook and open source it.

This repository contains all of the values & practices that we use here. It represents many hours of research, lots of thoughtful debates, and some serious introspection. It’s certainly not perfect, but I think it’s an exciting place to start.

Feel free to fork this repository and use any or all of these policies, and to modify them in whatever way makes sense for your company. I hope that by publishing them, other companies can benefit from my research and improve their own teams culture.

All feedback and suggestions (especially in the form of pull requests) are very appreciated. I’ve gotten several different perspectives to help arrive at these policies, but I am certainly missing many more and making mistakes as a result. This is a work in progress that I hope will get better with more time and more contributors.
