Yaaaay, final sprint in AMOS is done. What a rollercoaster this was, however it was a fun ride, so thanks AMOS Team for the continous support and this possibility to develop ourselves further!

All documentation can be found in our [Wiki](https://github.com/amosproj/amos2022ss06-idunion-blockchain-dashboard/wiki/User-Documentation), unfortunately no badly formatted PDFs here.
