    "# - ledger intended to store **Identity Records** that describe a **Ledger Identity**\n",
    "# - **Identity Records** are public data and may include Public Keys, Service Endpoints, Credential Schemas, Credential Definitions\n",
    "# - Every **Identity Record** is associated with exactly one **DID** (Decentralized Identifier) that is gloablly unique and resolvable (via a ledger) without requiring centralized resolution authority\n",
    "# - To maintain privacy each **Identity Owner** can own multiple DIDs\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ## DIDS\n",
    "# 1. Verinym\n",
    "#     - associated with **Legal Identity** of **Identity Owner**\n",
    "#     - all parties should be able to verify that some DID is used by a Government to publish schemas for some document type\n",
    "# 2. Pseudonym\n",
    "#     - **Blinded Identifier** to maintain privacy in the context of ongoing digital relationship (**Connection**)\n",

    "# - everyone who wants to publish on public permissioned ledger needs to get role of **Trust Anchor** on the ledger\n",

    "# - **first step towards being able to place transactions on the ledger involves getting role of Trust Anchor on the ledger**\n",

    "# - Set up connection to different existing pools (e.g. Sovrin pool), pool configuration needs to be set up\n",
    "# - list of nodes in the pool is stored in the ledger as NODE transactions\n",
    "# - Libindy allows you to restore actual list of NODE transactions by a few known transactions (genesis transactions)\n",
    "# - Each **Pool Configuration** defined as pair of pool configuration **name** and pool configuration **JSON**\n",
    "# - most important field in pool configuration: **path to the file with list of genesis transactions**\n",
    "#\n",
    "# ```pool.create_pool_ledger_config``` call allows you to create a named pool configuration\n",
    "# - After the pool configuration is created we can connect to the nodes pool that this configuration describes by ```calling pool.open_pool_ledger```\n",
    "#     - This call returns the pool handle that can be used to reference this opened connection in future libindy calls\n",
